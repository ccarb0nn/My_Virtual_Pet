PLAy MINI GAME

- User plays the ball game and tries to collect as much points as possible 
- These points can later buy items? 

	Catch Pet
	- This could also be a game that the player has to "compete" or beat the minigame/animal they are trying to catch to successfully catch it
	- One of the games could be guessing the correct "door" (1 of 3) and if you chose correctly it would result in you catching the pet.

WORLD
- Player tries and find the pet that randomly spawns (invisible)
- They must explore the area and search for the pet (could be in one of the homes, pond, hay barrel, barrel, garden, tree, rock, etc)
- Player has only a certain amount of time to find the pet before their time is up and the pet flees
- Chest can be opened to receive 100food.
- For catching pet just create a small box where when the player is colliding with it and presses enter, they will search the item for the pet
	- When they press enter to search, what it will do is provide a number (id for each item) and if it matches the random number, then they caught the pet
